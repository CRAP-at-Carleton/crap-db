Our focus is on the United States with topics under examination including white collar crime, racial disparities in the criminal justice system, mass incarceration and other transformations in punishment, prisoner reentry, and the risk of recidivism. In addition to understanding both classic and contemporary sociological research and theory, we will seek answers to questions like: What is crime? Who is considered a criminal? What social changes drove the United States to get \"tough\" on crime?\u00a0 What effects does incarceration have on prisoners, their families, their neighborhoods and communities? What happens when prisoners return to society?\u00a0", "prereq": "The department strongly recommends that Sociology/Anthropology 110 or 111 be taken prior to enrolling in courses numbered 200 or above", "building": "Leighton", "room_num": "303", "sched": {"mon": {"start": "1900-01-01 13:50:00", "end": "1900-01-01 15:00:00"}, "tue": {"start": null, "end": null}, "wed": {"start": "1900-01-01 13:50:00", "end": "1900-01-01 15:00:00"}, "thu": {"start": null, "end": null}, "fri": {"start": "1900-01-01 14:20:00", "end": "1900-01-01 15:20:00"}}},
